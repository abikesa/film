The makeup in "Citizen Kane" is indeed far from subtle, and that's part of its charm and effectiveness. The film, directed by Orson Welles and released in 1941, is often lauded for its innovative storytelling and technical achievements. Part of its groundbreaking approach was how it used makeup to age its characters, particularly Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles himself.

The aging makeup was ambitious for its time, with techniques that might not hold up to the high-definition scrutiny of modern films but were revolutionary back then. It added layers to the narrative, visually cueing the passage of time and the toll it took on the characters. This wasn't just about adding a few wrinkles or gray hairs; it was a dramatic transformation that helped tell a story of ambition, loss, and the ravages of time.

However, looking at it from today's perspective, the makeup can seem heavy-handed, especially given the more nuanced techniques available now. It's a product of its time, relying on broader strokes because the subtleties could be lost on the audiences or film technology of the 1940s. Despite this, the makeup's ambition and its role in storytelling should be appreciated. It was part of Welles' vision of a more theatrical cinema that didn't shy away from exaggeration to evoke emotion or convey a deeper narrative.
